# GPO-746-Rotary-Phone-Hack

Project that converts an old 746 PGO rotary phone into a complex internet of things machine!

Use the dialler on the phone to call up several "services" such as listening to the news headlines, talking to a robot operator, change tracks on your Spotify, get the weather and a lot more plannedâ€¦

Loaded on Raspberry Pi or similar.
